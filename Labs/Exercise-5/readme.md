# Task 01: Test the MCP Server using the MCP Inspector

## Introduction

MCP Inspector is a tool designed for the Model Context Protocol (MCP) ecosystem, primarily used for testing and debugging MCP servers, clients, and related components, especially during local development.

## Description

In this task, you will execute the `npx` command to launch the MCP Inspector, and configure the settings to reach the MCP Server to test the accessibility and correct responses from the MCP Server to valid its purpose.

## Success Criteria

- Connecting to the MCP Server from the MCP Inspector is successful.
- Testing a `GET` tool returns valid data from the SAP system.

# Task 02: Test the MCP Server using Visual Studio Code

## Introduction

In Visual Studio Code, MCP servers add tools for tasks to allow for interacting with external APIs like our SAP MCP Server.

## Description

In this task, you will use `Visual Studio Code` as an MCP Client to allow the GitHub Copilot in Agent Mode to access the SAP MCP Server we created and ask questions about your SAP Data in the Chat window.

## Success Criteria

- Add the SAP MCP Server to your Visual Studio Code Workspace and see all the tools available in the Chat Window configuration.
- In Natural Language, ask questions about your SAP system and receive valid responses in the Chat Window.
