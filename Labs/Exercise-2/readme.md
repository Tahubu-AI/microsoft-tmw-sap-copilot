# Task 02: Create named values for authentication

## Introduction

The SAP API requires authentication to access its resources. If you were to attempt testing the API now, you would receive a 401 Unauthorized error. To authenticate, you will use named values in Azure API Management to securely store your SAP demo credentials.

## Description

Named values in Azure API Management allow you to store sensitive information, such as API keys and passwords, securely. In this task, you will create named values for your SAP demo credentials.

## Success criteria

- Named values are created in Azure API Management to store your SAP demo credentials securely.

# Task 03: Configure inbound policy for authentication

## Introduction

To authenticate requests to the SAP API, you need to configure an inbound policy in Azure API Management that adds the necessary authentication headers using the named values you created in the previous task.

## Description

Inbound policies in Azure API Management allow you to modify incoming requests before they are forwarded to the backend service. In this task, you will configure an inbound policy to add the `Authorization` header required by the SAP API.

## Success criteria

- An inbound policy is configured in Azure API Management to add the `Authorization` header using the named values for your SAP demo credentials.
